This is a repository containing the macros I did for my physics laboratory course.

It contains a "master macro" (lab_macros.C) containing the relevant functions for all the other
three experiments (gamma, compton, imaging). To run them, it suffices to load them from ROOT.
This repository contains also a c++ simple program (estrai.cxx) and a latex script I used
to put the data generated by the macros in a format useful for latex tables.
